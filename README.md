# Wax-Seal-Melter

This project intends to create a wax seal melter, a device that outputs heat to a spoon that can be placed on top of it, enough to melt a wax seal.

The amount of heat will be controlled using a knob, but it will have a preset value of 150.

See Nichrome_Calc.c for electrical value calculation.

- This project was originally intended to be carried out using a nichrome wire coil conducting heat to a metal plate surface where a spoon can be laid. Considering calculations given through the Nichrome_Calc.c, the original plan is now being reconsidered due to its safety and performance issues. Heat transfer by conduction from the nichrome wire is much more unreliable as the heating plate will be spherical.
- The use of induction heating is under consideration due to its high efficiency and lack of heat remnants
