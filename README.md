# Wax-Seal-Melter

This project intends to create a wax-seal-melter, a device that outputs heat to a spoon that can be placed on top of it, enough to melt a wax seal.

The amount of heat will be controlled using a knob, but it will have a preset value of 150.

See Required Calculations.c for electrical value calculation.
